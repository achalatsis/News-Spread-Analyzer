The project is still premature and under heavy construction
Goal is to have an automated tool for extracting news spread patterns (and in the long term be able to identify sites reproducing hoaxes).

Prerequisites:
* python 3
* simplejson, google-api-python-client, beautifulsoup, readability-lxml. You can install them via pip.

In a file named serviceTokens.py you should declare a variable:
* readabilityToken, containing your Readability token
